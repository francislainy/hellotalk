# HelloTalk

HelloTalk is a Spring Boot API designed to feed a language learning system similar to the HelloTalk app. It allows users to interact with other users who are native in the language they are interested in learning but  are also learning the language their partner is native in. For example, a Brazilian person learning Chinese can interact with Chinese users who are learning Portuguese.

# Audience

This project is for anyone interested in checking my skills in Java and Spring Boot.

# Technology Stack

The API is built using Java and follows the Spring MVC approach. It was built using Maven and uses a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, with Pact tests being written before new functionality is added.
